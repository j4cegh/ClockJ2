# ClockJ2
A working semi-customizable clock made completely in Java!

# Use cases
I'll give you an example. This clock is amazing for an old laptop that you don't have a use for.
Find a room in your house, where you don't have a clock and put that laptop right there. Since it uses Java, it's also
compatible for Linux, and the app itself does not need many resources, so, you don't need a strong machine for it!
# Building
Since I have no idea if there's gonna be any binaries <strong>ever</strong>,
it's safe to assume people who are looking forward to this want to compile it.
To build this, you need to:
* Install <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows">Intellij Idea Community Edition</a>
* Import the project
* And, run! (assuming everything is downloaded correctly.)
## OR (<text style="color:red;">not recommended!</text>)
If you know what you're doing, you can also create your own project for this app
with the code provided.
